- [ ] **Error handling** for command failures
- [ ] **Resource limits** on command execution

## üèóÔ∏è Infrastructure Security

### AWS Security
- [ ] **IAM roles with minimal permissions**
- [ ] **Principle of least privilege**
- [ ] **AWS SSO integration** for authentication
- [ ] **Secure credential management**
- [ ] **Network security** (VPC, Security Groups)
- [ ] **Encryption at rest and in transit**

### CI/CD Security
- [ ] **Automated vulnerability scanning** in pipeline
- [ ] **Security gates** in deployment process
